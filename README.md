# Data and code for "Sequence clustering confounds AlphaFold2"

Each directory contains all data and code used to generate each figure.

CF-random structure predictions were generated with ColabFold1.5.3 as follows:

->  KaiB proteins: --max-seq 1 --max-extra-seq 2     
->  Mad2:          --max-seq 8 --max-extra-seq 16     
->  RfaH:          --max-seq 64 --max-extra-seq 128     

Programs were run on Linux and Mac OS 14.3.1.

Code for analysis written in python3 using the following libraries:

-> pandas     
-> numpy     
-> mdtraj     
-> matplotlib  
-> seaborn
