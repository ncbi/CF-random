# AF-cluster controls

Update: Figure S1a was initially run with the monomer preset (leftmost strip plot).  We learned that the monomer_ptm preset with sequence masking, model 1 only (middle strip plot) was the appropriate control for the AF-cluster results  in the rightmost strip plot.

**Model presets do not change our conclusions: whole MSA sampling still outperforms AF-cluster:**
