# AF-cluster controls

Update: Figure S1a was run with the monomer setting.  We learned that we should have used the monomer_ptm preset instead of monomer.  

**Model presets do not change the outcome: random sequence sampling still outperforms AF-cluster:**

The distribution of points for model 1 only is also shown separately, since Wayment-Steele et al. used only model 1.  Random sequence sampling still outperforms.
