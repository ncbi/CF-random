# Plots showing signal strength for KaiB, Mad2, and Rfah

Sums of z-scores for evolutionary couplings unique to the dominant/alternative fold (blue/red) and common to both folds (black) are shown at different MSA depths tested by CF-random. Coevolutionary information unique to alternative conformations is negligible at all MSA depths, indicating that it does not inform structure predictions.

**NOTE: Alternative conformation signal is flat**
